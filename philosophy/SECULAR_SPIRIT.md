# Ethical-Spiritual Foundations (Secular Form)

WiseWork is deeply inspired by timeless ethical-spiritual values â€” translated into universal, functional principles.  
Rather than referencing religious terminology, this document abstracts and implements their **mechanisms and meanings** into systemic design.
