# WiseWork System Overview

## 🔁 System Logic

WiseWork works through a regenerative loop:

**Action → Recognition (Proofs) → Reflection → System Evolution**

---

## 🧩 Modular Proof System

- 🧱 Proof of Role → Roles emerge from contribution
- 🧾 Proof of Contribution → Recognizes impact
- 🤝 Proof of Trust → Validates reliability through resonance
- 💬 Proof of Thought → Recognizes deep reflection
- 🔁 Proof of Revision → Documents learning and correction
- 🌐 Proof of Translation → Enables cultural bridging
- 🫶 Proof of Care → Makes invisible labor visible
- 👤 Proof of Presence → Acknowledges consistency

Each Proof updates the **Proof Ledger**, not to rank, but to remember context.

## ⚙️ RoleFlow Engine

Roles update dynamically based on behavior.  
No one declares their role — the system reflects it back, based on actions and verified patterns.

## 🧭 Governance Cycle

1. Issue arises  
2. Reflection & context gathering  
3. Proposal generation  
4. Deliberation (human & assisted)  
5. Consent or revision  
6. Implementation  
7. Review via Proof of Revision & Trust

---

## 🔄 Information Flow

Action → Proof → Role update → Governance input → Updated system → Repeat

---

## 🧬 Core Principles in Practice

- Ethics as protocol, not policy  
- Reflection as a core function  
- Roles as relational, not positional  
- Recognition of care, thought, and consistency  
- Trust emerges through pattern, not position

*WiseWork is not a platform. It is a protocol for building systems that listen, reflect, and evolve.*
