# Proof of WiseWork – Protocol Overview

This document defines the meta-logic of WiseWork’s modular proof system.  
Each "Proof" is a protocol-based validation of contribution, reflection, or presence — based on ethics, not extraction.

## 🧩 What is a Proof?

A Proof is a structured recognition of a meaningful contribution — validated through self-reporting, peer reflection, or protocol observation.  
Proofs are not rewards or scores. They are contextual records of value-in-action.

---

## 🔧 Structure of a Proof

Each Proof includes:

- **Contributor ID** (e.g. pseudonym or wallet)
- **Context** (project, discussion, space)
- **Type of contribution** (e.g. Thought, Care, Translation)
- **Intent** (optional — for ethical transparency)
- **Observed impact** (change, resonance, response)
- **Validation path** (self, peer, protocol, hybrid)
- **Timestamp + revision trail**

## 🧪 Core Proof Modules

| Proof | Function |
|-------|----------|
| 🧾 Contribution | Measures real input & outcomes |
| 💬 Thought | Captures reflection, critique, synthesis |
| 🔁 Revision | Records learning & change |
| 🤝 Trust | Tracks relational credibility via resonance |
| 🫶 Care | Makes invisible emotional labor visible |
| 👤 Presence | Acknowledges quiet, steady participation |
| 🌐 Translation | Bridges linguistic/cultural gaps |
| 🧱 Role | Emerges from action + reflection via RoleFlow |

---

## 🧠 Validation Methods

- **Self-declared**: with intent and trace  
- **Peer-reviewed**: soft consensus or resonance  
- **Protocol-assisted**: GPT or on-chain signals  
- **Hybrid**: AI + human review

---

## 🔁 Proof Lifecycle

1. Contribution happens  
2. Participant (or system) submits a Proof  
3. Optional validation by peers or system  
4. Proof is added to the **Proof Ledger**  
5. RoleFlow and governance may reflect new data  
6. Feedback and revision possible (via Proof of Revision)

---

## 📖 Use Cases

- Create shared memory without surveillance  
- Enable governance by contribution, not power  
- Support cultural plurality (Proofs adapt, core stays stable)

---

## ⚠️ Principles for All Proofs

- Never punitive  
- Always revisable  
- No ranking or gamification  
- Transparent but respectful of privacy  
- Culturally inclusive

*Proof is not a reward. It's a reflection.*
