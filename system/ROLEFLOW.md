# RoleFlow Engine

## 🎯 Purpose

The RoleFlow Engine dynamically reflects and updates participant roles based on lived contributions and verifiable proof patterns.  
It replaces fixed hierarchies with fluid, context-sensitive role emergence — guided by ethics, pattern recognition, and transparent input.

---

## 🧬 Core Principles

- **Roles are not claimed – they are observed.**
- **No one has one fixed role – roles adapt to context and contribution.**
- **Roles are always open to challenge, evolution, and reflection.**

---

## 🔁 Inputs to RoleFlow

- Verified Proofs (e.g. Contribution, Trust, Care, Thought)
- Participation rhythm (e.g. Presence)
- Peer resonance & trust signals
- Optional self-reflections

---

## 🧠 Role Recognition Flow

1. **Proof pattern detected** (via protocol or assisted AI)
2. **Matching roles identified** (e.g. Synthesizer, Connector, Catalyst)
3. **Role attribution suggested (non-binding)**  
4. **Community or peer confirmation (soft validation)**

## 🧱 Example Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🧠 Synthesizer | Weaves ideas and patterns into shared insight |
| 🫂 Careholder | Holds emotional or group dynamics |
| 🧭 Navigator | Guides ethical decision processes |
| 🌐 Translator | Bridges between languages, cultures, or domains |
| 🔍 Challenger | Questions assumptions, invites reflection |
| 🧱 Builder | Contributes tangible artifacts (code, docs, tools) |
| 🔗 Connector | Links people, resources, and knowledge flows |
| 📖 Mirror | Reflects back what the system is saying or missing |

## 🛡 Ethics in RoleFlow

- No gamification  
- No ranking  
- All roles are revisable and non-exclusive  
- Roles should never become identity or entitlement

---

## 🔄 Feedback Loop

```text
Proofs → RoleFlow analysis → Role attribution → Community feedback → Role memory
```

RoleFlow can be used to:
- Guide task invitations
- Balance governance participation
- Highlight silent but essential contributors

*RoleFlow is not a badge system. It is a mirror of contribution in motion.*
