# 🤝 Contributing to WiseWork

Thank you for considering contributing to **WiseWork**! We welcome contributions of all kinds — from code, documentation, and tests to ideas, governance logic and community building.

---

## 🧠 Principles

WiseWork is an open protocol to enable verifiable contribution, ethical coordination, and collective intelligence.  
We value:

- 🌍 Impact over activity
- 🧩 Clarity over complexity
- 🤝 Transparency over hierarchy

---

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Requirements
- `git`
- `docker` (for full-stack simulation)
- [optional] `Foundry` or `Hardhat` (for smart contract testing)
- Node.js (`>=18`) if working with frontend modules

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fatdinhero/wisework.git
cd wisework
docker compose up --build
```

---

## 🌿 Git Workflow

We follow a simplified GitHub Flow:

1. Create a feature branch  
   e.g. `feature/wiseproof-score`, `fix/docs-typo`, `chore/update-readme`

2. Make your changes and commit with clear messages  
   We recommend [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

3. Open a Pull Request against `main`

4. Make sure all CI checks pass before requesting review

---

## ✅ PR Requirements

Every Pull Request must:
- Contain a clear description of the changes
- Reference any related issues (e.g. `Closes #42`)
- Pass all CI checks
- Agree to the licensing terms (see PR template)

---

## 🧪 Testing

Coming soon — we’ll provide testing instructions for smart contracts and governance modules.  
For now, please ensure markdown lint and link checks pass.

---

## 🔐 Licensing

By submitting a Pull Request, you agree that your contribution is licensed under the Apache License 2.0 and may also be released under a future AGPL version if the maintainers decide to adopt it.

---

## 🗣️ Communication

For feedback, ideas or governance-related proposals, please open a [Discussion](https://github.com/fatdinhero/wisework/discussions) or contact @fatdinhero.

Let's build wisely — together.
