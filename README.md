# WiseWork

**Return on Humanity – A protocol for collective intelligence, responsibility, and reflection.**

This repository contains the foundational documents and protocols for WiseWork, an open infrastructure for regenerative collaboration and decentralized wisdom.

## Key Components
- Vision & Manifest
- Ethical & Governance principles
- Modular proof systems (e.g., Proof of Role, Thought, Trust, Translation)
- Technology architecture
- Community onboarding & contribution models

## 🧩 WiseProof Modules

WiseWork uses a modular system of "Proofs" to recognize meaningful contributions, reflection, and trust across human collaboration.

| Proof | Purpose | Issue |
|-------|---------|-------|
| 🧱 **Proof of Role** – Assigns roles based on real action and emerging patterns | [View Issue #1](https://github.com/fatdinhero/wisework/issues/1) |
| 🧾 **Proof of Contribution** – Measures impact, not noise | [View Issue #2](https://github.com/fatdinhero/wisework/issues/2) |
| 🤝 **Proof of Trust** – Captures relational reputation & resonance | [View Issue #3](https://github.com/fatdinhero/wisework/issues/3) |
| 💬 **Proof of Thought** – Tracks reflective, deep, and contextual thinking | [View Issue #4](https://github.com/fatdinhero/wisework/issues/4) |
| 🧭 **Governance Principles** – Adaptive structure and ethical scaffolding | [View Issue #5](https://github.com/fatdinhero/wisework/issues/5) |
| 🔁 **Proof of Revision** – Makes learning & transformation visible | [View Issue #6](https://github.com/fatdinhero/wisework/issues/6) |
| 🌐 **Proof of Translation** – Enables semantic bridges across cultures | [View Issue #7](https://github.com/fatdinhero/wisework/issues/7) |
| 🫶 **Proof of Care** – Recognizes invisible emotional & relational work | [View Issue #8](https://github.com/fatdinhero/wisework/issues/8) |
| 👤 **Proof of Presence** – Values quiet consistency and space-holding | [View Issue #9](https://github.com/fatdinhero/wisework/issues/9) |

## How to Contribute

WiseWork is in early development. You can contribute by:

- Reviewing the whitepaper and proposing additions via Issues
- Helping draft or refine the WiseProof protocols
- Participating in the RoleFlow engine design
- Suggesting real-world challenges to build first use cases

Feel free to open an Issue or Discussion with your thoughts.

Together, we build the ethical infrastructure for collective intelligence.
