# WiseWork Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the phased development of the WiseWork protocol, infrastructure, and ecosystem.  
Each phase builds on the previous, moving from vision to system to community.

---

## 📘 Phase 0: Foundation (Complete / In Progress)

✅ Define vision, mission, and ethical core  
✅ Design modular proof architecture  
✅ Create RoleFlow and governance logic  
✅ Launch public GitHub repository  
✅ Publish index.md landing page  
✅ Setup system documentation (this repo)  

---

## 🧱 Phase 1: Open Specification (Q2 2025)

- Finalize all core protocol documents:
  - `PROOF_PROTOCOL.md`
  - `ROLEFLOW.md`
  - `GOVERNANCE.md`
  - `WHITEPAPER.md`
- Publish all Proofs as public GitHub Issues
- Create Proof System Diagram (SVG/PNG)
- Define basic schemas (JSON/Markdown) for Proof entries
- Invite early feedback (GitHub Discussions)

---

## 🤝 Phase 2: Co-Creation & Community Layer (Q3 2025)

- Launch GitHub Discussions & onboarding guide  
- Create modular contribution templates  
- Prototype lightweight Proof submission interface (Markdown/GPT-based)  
- Establish principles for contributor roles & validation  
- Publish example use cases (e.g. education, research, civic orgs)

---

## ⚙️ Phase 3: Technical Integration (Q4 2025 – Q1 2026)

- AI-assisted RoleFlow engine prototype  
- GPT + GitHub integration for Proof validation  
- Optional blockchain layer (Scroll / Optimism / Arbitrum)  
- Launch open contribution API / Proof gateway  
- IPFS-based archival of contribution data (optional)

---

## 🌍 Phase 4: Decentralized Implementation & Adaptation (2026+)

- Regional forks and adaptations (e.g. multilingual, sector-specific)  
- Open grant strategy for use-case communities  
- Community-led governance experiments  
- Ethical upgrade cycles (via Proof of Revision)  
- Research partnerships for system evaluation

---

## 💡 Guiding Principle

> Start slow, build deep.  
> Design for trust before scale.

*This roadmap is alive. Every step is open to revision through proof and reflection.*
