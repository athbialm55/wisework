# Proof of WiseWork

**A non-transferable record of meaningful contribution, rooted in reflection, responsibility and real-world relevance.**

## What is a Proof of WiseWork?

Proof of WiseWork is issued to contributors who meaningfully participate in a WiseWork process, applying their strengths, insight and presence to advance collective understanding and social impact.

It is not a token of status, but a **marker of participation with purpose**.
